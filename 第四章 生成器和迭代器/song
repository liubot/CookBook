Love makes weak
You said you cherised freedom so
You refused to let it go
Follow your faith
Love and hate
never failed to seize the day
Don't give yourself away
Oh when the night falls
And your all alone
In your deepest sleep
What are you dreeeming of
My skin's still burning from your touch
Oh You just can't get enough
You said I wouldn't ask for much
But your eyes are dangerous
